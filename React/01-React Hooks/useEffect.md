### 1
**The Effect Hook lets us perform _side effects_ in functional components, it is a close replacement for componentDidMount, componentsDidUpdate and componentsWillUnmount**


### 2
**UseEffect runs after every render of the component.**  
**When we specify useEffect, we are basically requesting React to execute the function that is passed as an argument every time the component renders.**

### 3
**useEffect is placed inside the component, by doing this, we can easily access the components' state and props without having to write any addtional code.**
