**No, Bertha and Xaview will hook up, because Xavier is the 1st priority of Bertha, and Xavier rather to date with Bertha instead of Clare, and leave Clare and Yancey unmatched**   


## Example

**1st round: Victor propose Bertha, Bertha accepets his propose since no one else propose her  
2nd round: Wyatt propose Diane, Diane has no choice but accept his propose since no one else propose her  
3rd round: Xavier propose Bertha, they are the top prortiy for each of them, sadly, Bertha dumped Victor for Xavier**

**4th round: Then, Victor is back to propose Amy, Victor is not the top guy for Amy, but Amy think it is good enough**  
**5th round, Yancey propose Amy, but didn't success, so he proposed Diane, Diane accepts Yancey and dumps Wyatt**

**6th round: Wyatt got rejected by a lot people, until found Clare, and Clare acceptes his propose**    
**7th round: Yancey got rejected by everyone, propose to his least favorite one, and Erika acceptes**

**We have a stable matching here. Although Amy likes Zeus more, Zeus likes his matched one more than Amy. Same for Diane, she likes Victor more, but Victor likes his matched one more than Dianee. Turns out, there is no way to unstablize the match**  

**Running Time is O(n^2)**
### We will always get stable matching by using the above algorithm
