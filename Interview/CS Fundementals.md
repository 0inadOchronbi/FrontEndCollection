## What are some important features in OOP?
1. Encapsulation: The ability to hide the implementation details of a class from other parts of the code. This allows for data protection and data hiding, which promotes code reusability and maintainability.
2. Inheritance: The ability for a class to inherit the properties and methods of another class. This allows for code reuse and eliminates the need to write redundant code.
3. Polymorphism: The ability of a single function or method to operate on multiple types of data or objects.
