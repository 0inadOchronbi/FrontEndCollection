## What are some important features in OOP?
1. Encapsulation
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism refers to the ability of a single function or method to operate on multiple types of data or objects. This allows for flexibility and code reuse, as a single function can be used with different types of objects, rather than having to write a separate function for each type. In most OOP languages, polymorphism is achieved through the use of interfaces, abstract classes, and virtual functions.
