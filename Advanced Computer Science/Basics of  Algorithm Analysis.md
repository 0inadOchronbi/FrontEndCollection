## Polynomial-Time

**Brute force**  
For many non-trivial problems, there is a natural brute force search algorithm that checks every possible solution.
-  Typically takes 2N time or worse for inputs of size N.
- Unacceptable in practice.

**Desirable scaling property**  
When the input size doubles, the algorithm should only slow down by some constant factor C.

- An algorithm is poly-time if the above scaling property holds. choose **C = 2^d**  

## Worst-Case Analysis
### Worst case running time.  Obtain bound on largest possible running time of algorithm on input of a given size N.
- Generally captures efficiency in practice.
- Draconian view, but hard to find effective alternative. 

### Average case running timeã€‚ Obtain bound on running time of algorithm on **random** input as a function of input size N.
- Hard (or impossible) to accurately model real instances by random 
distributions.
- Algorithm tuned for a certain distribution may perform poorly on 
other inputs.
